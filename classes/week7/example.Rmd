## This is the Name of my Project
#### This is the subtitle


**First Section**
This is where I am going to write a basic part of my project and show the libraries.
```{R echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
data(diamonds)
```

Then I will wrote some thigns where I put an inline piece that code that will tell you that this dataset has `r nrow(diamonds)` individual pieces of data.  

Then I am going to make another block of code that I print to screen the summary of the data.
```{R echo = TRUE}
summary(diamonds)
```


**Second Section**
This is where I make *some more analysis* and do some things.
```{R}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = price),
                 bins = 50, fill = 'dark red') +
  labs(title = "Here is my title",
       x = "This is the X axis",
       y = "This is the y axis") +
  theme_light()
```

Then here at the bottom I can add my final thoughts and awesome analysis that will get me hired!
