I am regular text.

# I am a big header
###### I am a very small header


*I am in italics*

**I am bold!**

I have some `inline typed code` inside of me.

```
I am a
block of any
kind of code
but with no special formatting
```

```JSON
{
    "what": "value",
    "how_many": 12,
    "ready": true,
    "missing": null
}
```

```R
library(dplyr)

foo <- dataframe %>%
  filter(bar > 12)
```

+ I am an element in a list
+ I am also an element.

I am some text with a link to [Google](https://www.google.com/).
