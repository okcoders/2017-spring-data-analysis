# In-class Exercises: Week 2 Session 1

set.seed(101)


# Compound Logic -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

nums <- c(1:25)


# What is the sum of the values in the nums greater than 11 but less than or equal to 19?


# What is the mean of all values that are either 22 or less than 8?


# What is the standard deviation of values that are either less than or equal to 12 but not
# including 7?



# Distributions ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Compute the sum of 329 random normally distributed values from a distribution with a mean
# of 10 and a standard deviation of 3.


# Plot a simple histogram of 2500 values drawn from a beta distribution with shape
# parameters of 0.9 and 3.1.



# Data Frames --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Load the built-in iris DataFrame so it can be used, and look at the last 6 rows.


# How many rows and columns does the iris data set contain?


# What are the unique values of the Species value?


# What is the average Sepal Length for flowers from the versicolor species?


# Add a new column to the data called "Sepal.Total" that is computed as the sum of the sepal
# length and width of each flower.


# What is the correlation of the new total sepal value to the width of each flower's petal?


# Make a small multiples plot of all of the values in iris, including the new one you just added.
