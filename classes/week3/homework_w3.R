# Go to data.gov and find a dataset that looks interesting. Download the dataset
# and read it into R where you can explore it. Make sure the dataset has at least
# 5 distinct variables/columns and at least 500 or more records so you have
# lots to explore. Use the tools you have learned so far to do some exploration.

# Keep all of your code in this file, including a link were someone else can
# go download the dataset and run your code to see your analysis. Find at least
# one interesting thing/pattern in the data and be prepared to walk the class
# through what you found and how you found it.

# Additionally, comment the different sections of code you write where someone
# else would be able to follow what analytic path you were taking.

# This is a good practice run for your first project next week!
