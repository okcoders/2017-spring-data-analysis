# In-class Exercises

# Load the dplyr and jsonlite libraries


# Load the Company Employees JSON file as a dplyr DataFrame, the same as the previous exercises.


# NOTE: This is the same as the final problem as the prior session notes----------------------------
# Of all of the employees whose worth is more than 5% over their company's average, which one
# has the longest email address? Make the same output file of their first name, last name, and
# email address, but there is no need to write it out this time.



# Which female manager has a total worth the highest above their respective total company average?
# Include only the first and last name, the company name, and the percent different as a translated
# value (i.e. 35% would be 35.0 instead of 0.35); but make the names of the headers be: First, Last,
# Organization, and PercentDiff.



# Meat Data ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Go to the Link Below and download the CSV file ZIP package at the bottom.
# https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/livestock-and-meat-international-trade-data/livestock-and-meat-international-trade-data/#Zipped%20CSV%20files
# Load the LivestockMeat_Imports.csv dataset CSV as a dplyr dataframe and run a summary on it to
# see what it looks like.



# For the countries of Canada, Poland, Denmark, and Ireland; in what year for each did Bacon
# represent the maximum percent of total imports into the US. Show only the Country, Year, and
# PercentImports (with those column names) for each country only for the maximum year. Your
# output data should only be 4 rows long, and ordered alphabetically by the name of the Country.
