# Load the diamonds dataset


# Make a histogram of the price of all diamonds in the set. Set the binwidth such that each bin
# will represent $1000 of price value.


# Make a scatter plot of the depth vs carat size of each diamond. Make sure to set the alpha of the
# points small enough that we can see where the density shows up in the set.


# Improve this same scatter plot to show different colors for each clarity level.


# Let's go one step further and make a 2 dimensional density plot of this same data (not including
# the clarity).


# Make a density plot of the price of all "Fair" cut diamonds.


# Make column chart by clarity of the median carat size of each group of diamonds. Make the bars
# red with a black outline, and give both the X and Y axes friendly names, with a clean title.


# Make a violin plot of price by cut for all that have a greater than average price and carat size
# for their clarity level. Name the plot 'Distribution of Large and Expensive Diamonds', and give
# a friendly label to the y axis. Choose and implement a custom theme, and please make each violin
# a different color.
